# JSVAuto
totally awful way to cache bust your web files by automating query string parameter updates

come join us (or probably just me) in our Discord server to do absolutely nothing or to bug report and contribute: https://discord.gg/t2RK2CkQa7

# Wanna workin' version of this heap on a live website? Visit https://versionwidget.epizy.com/autoversion/autoVersioner.html
# Don't forget to thank and check out our host for it, InfinityFree!

# But if you wanna host it yourself. . . Perfectly fine! Simply set up a place to host it (local hosting gets wonky with the anti-cross-scriptingajdojidqkdnalnknc whatever it is) and upload the "autoversion" folder to any place where you can get it displayed.
